# PORTFOLIO

Welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find a collection of various projects I have completed.

## Project Overview

### Course_Projects

These projects were completed as part of university courses. The courses comprise:

+ **Computer Programming Language |** An entry-level programming course that covers the fundamentals of *C++* and basic concepts.
 
+ **Pratical Data Structures and Algorithms |** Focused on theoretical comprehension and practical application of Algorithms and Data Structures using *Java*.

+ **Principles and Applications of Microcontrollers-Mechatronics |** Utilized *ATmega328P microcontroller* using *AVR Assembly Language* and *Arduino* for integration into mechatronic systems.   
 
### Research_Projects

Research Assistant in *Biophotonics and Bioimaging Laboratory, NTU*
+ **CALF | Application of Deep Learning Algorithms on Dynamic Video for
Recognition and Analysis of Dairy Calf Behaviors |** An ongoing research project aimed at using a *Video-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)* to identify the behaviors of dairy calves, as well as analyzing and detecting abnormalities in their behavior data.

### Competitions

I have participated in the **Field Robot Competition** twice, which aims to challenge teams to design and build robots capable of executing a variety of tasks with precision and efficiency.

+ **2021 Field Robot Competition |** Autonomous Navigation, Object Detection, Robotic Arm Gripping Objects
+ **2022 Field Robot Competition |** Autonomous Navigation, Object Detection *(YOLOv4-tiny)*, Automated Irrigation

### Qt

These are side projects developed using the Qt framework.

+ **Qt_Illustrator |** A computer graphics software that offers features such as drawing with a brush, importing text or image files, and selecting and transforming graphics like copy, paste, and move.
+ **Pixel_Palette |** An image editing GUI that allows color adjustments, flipping, and applying filters to images.
