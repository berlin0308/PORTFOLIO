# Application of Deep Learning Algorithms on Dynamic Video for Recognition and Analysis of Dairy Calf Behaviors

## Summary

+ Design and Deploy the sensing devices for Data Collection, with **Raspberry Pi** serving as the primary processing unit.
+ **Train a Video-based CNN** using **PyTorch** for Action Recognition and **Evaluate its performance**.
+ Examine the time allocation and behavioral bouts of calves to analyze their **Behavioral Patterns** throughout the day.
+ **Develop a Real-time Monitoring and Alarm System** by integrating **Internet of Things (IoT)** technologies and leveraging Machine Learning for **Anomaly Detection**. 
+ The system is aimed to enhance the operational efficiency for farm managers and promotes the well-being of dairy calves.
