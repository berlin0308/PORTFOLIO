Project Proposal is available [here](https://github.com/berlin0308/PORTFOLIO/blob/main/Research_Projects/CALF/Docs/%E8%A8%88%E5%8A%83%E6%9B%B8_%E6%87%89%E7%94%A8%E5%8B%95%E6%85%8B%E5%BD%B1%E5%83%8F%E6%B7%B1%E5%BA%A6%E5%AD%B8%E7%BF%92%E6%BC%94%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95%E9%80%B2%E8%A1%8C%E7%8A%A2%E7%89%9B%E8%A1%8C%E7%82%BA%E8%BE%A8%E8%AD%98%E8%88%87%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90.pdf)

## Summary

+ Design and Deploy the sensing devices for Data Collection, with **Raspberry Pi** serving as the primary processing unit.
+ **Train a Video-based CNN** using **PyTorch** for Action Recognition and **Evaluate its performance**.
+ Examine the time allocation and behavioral bouts of calves to analyze their **Behavioral Patterns** throughout the day.
+ **Develop a Real-time Monitoring and Alarm System** by integrating **Internet of Things (IoT)** technologies and leveraging Machine Learning for **Anomaly Detection**. 
+ The system is aimed to enhance the operational efficiency for farm managers and promotes the well-being of dairy calves.
